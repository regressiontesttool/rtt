 * SiPLE's ordinary name space is block-structured. Especially, procedure

 * other entities the declare before use rule applies. The supported name
 * analysis provides facillities to search for an entity by name. The search
 * returns all appropriate entities in scope. Additionally, each construct that
 * must be associated with exactly one entity (E.g. references) has an
 * attribute, that refers to the associated construct or is null, iff the
 * construct does not exist or is ambiguous.

 * SiPLE programs can be interpreted. To interpret a SiPLE program means to
 * execute its statements, starting with a call to the main procedure. Each
 * statement can change the program's internal state. The interpretation's
 * result is either, an interpretation exception iff the program is erroneous
 * or the final state otherwise. Since SiPLE is Turing complete, the
 * interpretation of a program might also not terminate at all.
 * 
 * Instead of interpreting the complete program at once, it is also possible
 * to interpret single statements or to compute the value of single
 * expressions starting from a given interpretation state. Again, errors
 * encountered while interpretation result in appropriate exceptions.
